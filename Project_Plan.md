# Project Plan
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a web-based presentation desk that allows users to showcase their personal profile, memorable work/school experiences, learnings during the internship, and selected engineering topics. The application will be built using a Node.js-based stack (React.js + Express.js) and will feature PowerPoint-like page switching behavior.
## Design Plan
### Layout
<ul>
<li>A single-page application (SPA) with smooth transitions between sections.</li>
<li>Navigation bar or buttons for switching between pages (e.g., "Previous" and "Next").</li>
<li>Each section will occupy the full viewport height and width for a clean, presentation-like feel. </li>
</ul>

### Style
<ul>
<li>Minimalistic and professional design.</li>
<li>Consistent typography and color scheme across all pages.Animations for page transitions (e.g., slide-in, fade-in) using CSS or a library.</li>
</ul>
